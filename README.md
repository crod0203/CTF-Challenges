# CTF-Challenges
Selected, sanitized writeups of pwn.college CTF-style labs plus small Linux scripts and network-forensics notes. Focused on methodology, lessons learned, and responsible disclosure â€” no real flags, credentials, or weaponized exploit code. Ideal for recruiters and teammates to evaluate my practical skills.
