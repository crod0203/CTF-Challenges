Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  
This repository showcases my **hands-on labs, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and technical reports** completed in controlled environments — including **pwn.college** and **VirtualBox network labs**.  
All writeups are **sanitized**: no flags, credentials, or live exploit payloads are included.

## 🔒 Featured Projects

### 🧩 **pwn-college-labs/**
Contains my collection of **Labs 1–11** from [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), demonstrating Linux security, networking, and exploitation fundamentals.

**Topics covered include:**
- Linux permissions, privilege escalation, and shell operations  
- Network scanning and service discovery (`nmap`, `netcat`, `tcpdump`)  
- Binary analysis and debugging (`gdb`, `pwndbg`)  
- Secure scripting and automation in Bash/Python  

📂 Each folder includes `Carlos-Rodriguez-Lab##.pdf` and optional short summaries in `README.md`.

---

### ⚙️ **linux-scripts/**
Small, self-contained Linux utilities and helper scripts created during labs for automation and reconnaissance tasks.  
All files are sanitized — no live IPs, credentials, or tokens.

---

### 🧾 **reports/**
Academic and internship-based PDF reports focusing on threat analysis, risk mitigation, and incident documentation.
